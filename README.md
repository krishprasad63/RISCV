Hi, this is the set of codes for implementing a 5-stage pipeline processor RISC-V.
As it is 5-stage, the five stages are,
1. Fetch Stage : To Fetch Indtruction
2. Decode Stage : Decode Instruction
3. Execute Stage : Execute Operation from ALU
4. Memory Stage : Handle memory
5. Write Back Stage
 This RISCV is able to perform ALU Operation.
